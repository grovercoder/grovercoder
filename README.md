## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Python developer focused on building **boring, predictable, and strictly typed** libraries that just work. My philosophy is simple: write code that stays out of your way and lets you focus on what matters.

### Core Expertise

- **Payment Processing** — Stripe integrations done right
- **Backend Development** — FastAPI, Flask, and modern Python frameworks
- **Email Infrastructure** — Filtering, backup systems, and mail flow optimization
- **Type-Safe APIs** — Python 3.13+ with proper typing and zero fluff

## 📂 My GitHub Presence

I maintain two distinct spaces on GitHub, each with a specific purpose:

### 🔬 [GroverCoder](https://github.com/grovercoder) — Research & Learning

This is where I post **research projects** as I work through concepts or learning steps. Think of it as my public lab notebook—experimental, exploratory, and evolving.

**Featured Projects:**
| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [**mailflow**](https://github.com/grovercoder/mailflow) | Email account filtering and backup system |

### 🏗️ [ElderCrank](https://github.com/eldercrank) — Official & Commercial Tools

> *"Old enough to know better, still stubborn enough to do it right."*

ElderCrank is my Python library workshop for **production-ready, commercial-leaning tools**. Everything here follows strict principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **No Magic** | Explicit over implicit. Always. |
| 🔧 **Modern Plumbing** | Built for Python 3.13+ using `uv` and `hatchling` |
| ✅ **Zero Flaky APIs** | Only vetted, reliable code makes it in |
| 📦 **Clean Namespacing** | Everything under `eldercrank` |

**Featured ElderCrank Projects:**
| Repository | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| [**stripe-core**](https://github.com/eldercrank/stripe-core) | Proper Stripe payment handling; data operations & webhook processing | `beta` |
| [**stripe-fastapi**](https://github.com/eldercrank/stripe-fastapi) | FastAPI integration for Stripe webhooks | `beta` |
| [**stripe-flask**](https://github.com/eldercrank/stripe-flask) | Flask integration for Stripe webhooks | `beta` |

All ElderCrank **public** libraries are **MIT licensed** and built with type safety in mind.
